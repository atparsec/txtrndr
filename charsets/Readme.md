You can add your custom character sets in here. The format is a simple text file, where the first line contains the list of characters,
and the second line represents whether these characters should be treated as visually dense (such as for symbols)

Example:
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789
dense=False
```
